The lovably odd Icelandic musician is being sued by<strong> Matthew Barney</strong>, the very man who apparently broke her heart and ran off with another woman.</p><p><a href=#>Page Six</a> reported on Wednesday, April 1, that Bjork's ex is suing for custody of their 12-year-old daughter <strong>Isadora</strong>, claiming that the songstress, 49, has monopolized time with the tween. According to the paper, acclaimed multimedia artist Barney, 48, filed the lawsuit in Brooklyn Supreme Court against Bjork Gunmundsdottir.</p><p>In the documents, he is reportedly seeking a more equivalent schedule with Isadora, and claims that Bjork "is effectively sacrificing Doa’s emotional well-being in favor of her own selfish desires."</p><p>He also blasts the singer for having a "self-focused mindset," and for believing that "she has far greater rights than I do as Doa’s father; and, in part, from her insistence that I am solely to blame for the breakdown of our relationship and the end of our intact family."</p><p>The Fort Greene-based artist further claims in the suit that their daughter "has stated, on her own initiative, that she wants" equal time with her parents.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Barney and Bjork were together for 13 years before they split in 2013, after he ran off with a fellow artist, <a href=#>according to the singer herself</a>. In an interview with <a href=#>Pitchfork</a>, Bjork described her breakup with Barney as "the most painful thing" she has ever experienced.</p><p>"It really is in the lyrics. I've never really done lyrics like this, because they're so teenage, so simple," she said at the time. "I wrote them really quickly. But I also spent a long time on them to get them just right. It's so hard to talk about the subject matter; it's impossible — I'm sorry."</p><p>The Oscar nominee — who famously wore the swan dress to the 2001 Academy Awards — has based her recently released ninth studio album Vulnicura on the heartbreaking experience. Personal strife or not, the "Human Behavior" singer and her 20-plus years of work in music and other disciplines are explored and celebrated in a retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in NYC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJmjp6KgwG6x12akmqyknbK4ecGaqaedqWLAtrHSZp2oql2YwrTAzp2wZqeWYsGpscirZJ2ZpZy1tbHRZmlpaWVngQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
