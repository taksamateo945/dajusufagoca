Art is kind of imitating life right now for Dawson. She is set to appear in the upcoming USA series Briarpatch. Her character, Allegra Dill, is involved with a high-profile senator played by Enrique Murciano.
In real life, the actress had been low-key dating Booker. The two had chosen to live a relatively private lifestyle until he decided to make a play for the oval office."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Dawson is concentrating on the more serious side of dating a man running for president. One thing that is a struggle for the actress is the double standard that comes with being involved with Booker.</p><p>“He’s hoping to make the Zombieland premiere, but I’m curious to see if he doesn’t if he’s going to get the same amount of press being like ‘why aren’t you supporting your women. I’ve been getting all this press like ‘Why aren’t you at your man’s side’ when I’ve made it really clear that it’s okay to be a working mom,” Dawson declared.</p><p>There is a stigmatism attached to how they are supposed to support each other in the public eye. It is one of the reasons Dawson has always tried to keep her personal life private. Obviously maintaining an out of the spotlight romance goes out the window when your man wants to run the country.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B1KC1CxJHeP/</p><p>Speaking of Booker as a political candidate, Dawson isn’t going to back him just because they are in a relationship.</p><p>“Regardless of Cory, I wasn’t going to be behind any particular candidate this election. I really just want to be behind the electorate. This election is really really critical. A lot of the themes that are touched on in Briarpatch are really, narratively critical for us to be talking about in a wider space so that people can come to the table and see where their position is and see where they can be active. We need all hands on decks,” she admitted.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What do you think of Rosario Dawson’s comments on boyfriend Corey Booker?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeipMCivsioZJ2Zp6i8r3nOqZynq12qvW6twaisrWWUlsGqusZmp6ikmam2pLXAp2Scp6Kaxm6uzqiinqpdaH56fI9sZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
