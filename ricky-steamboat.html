On the September 14, 1985 edition of Championship Wrestling, Steamboat defeated Mr. Fuji, but after his victory he was attacked by Fuji’s protege Don Muraco, pitting Steamboat in a feud against Muraco and Fuji. During a televised episode of WWF Championship Wrestling, Steamboat and Muraco were scheduled for a match that never officially started after Muraco jumped Steamboat before the bell. Following the beat down, Muraco and Fuji then used Steamboat’s karate black belt to hang him outside the ring from the top rop before Steamboat was finally saved by Tito Santana and the Junkyard Dog. On the November 2 Saturday Night’s Main Event III, he defeated Fuji in a kung fu challenge. On the January 4, 1986 Saturday Night’s Main Event IV, his intense feud with Muraco ended after he and the JYD beat Muraco and Fuji in a tag team match.</p><p>In 1985, Steamboat was offered a contract by Vince McMahon and he joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Shortly after his debut (where he defeated Steve Lombardi on Championship Wrestling), Steamboat was given the gimmick of a babyface nicknamed “the Dragon”; Steamboat’s jacket-and-trunks attire was replaced by a keikogi and long tights. Steamboat’s mother is Japanese American, hence his Asian features which were crucial for his “Dragon” gimmick. Steamboat kept the nickname and gimmick for the remainder of his career.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Ricky Steamboat height</b> <strong>5 ft 10 in</strong> Ricky <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 10 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In 1977, Steamboat entered the National Wrestling Alliance-sanctioned Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) (which ran under the concurrent brand names “Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling” and “Wide World Wrestling”—later “World Wide Wrestling”—as well as airing syndicated TV programs under those respective names), where he would remain for the next eight years of his career. Steamboat, who had been brought in by JCP booker George Scott on the recommendation of Wahoo McDaniel, was initially billed as a babyface protege of Wahoo, and barely spoke above whispers in interviews. Matching him with his brash young counterpart, Ric Flair, was a natural fit. Steamboat was doing an interview on the syndicated Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling when Flair, then Mid-Atlantic television champion, began goading him. Steamboat knocked Flair out with a backhand chop to set up a match between the two. Steamboat’s star-making performance came when he pinned Flair after a double thrust off the top rope to win the NWA Mid-Atlantic Television Championship at WRAL studios in Raleigh, North Carolina.</p><p align=justify>Blood has been married five times.

Steamboat lost the match by countout but after the match, Savage continued to assault him and injured Steamboat’s larynx (kayfabe) with the ring bell, beginning an angle between the two. On the January 3, 1987 Saturday Night’s Main Event IX, Steamboat returned from his injury and prevented Savage from attacking George Steele like he had done to Steamboat six weeks prior. At WrestleMania III, Steamboat defeated Savage for the Intercontinental Championship.

Also ranked in the elit <strong>list of famous people born in United States</strong>. Ricky Steamboat celebrates birthday on February 28 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Several weeks after winning the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, Steamboat asked WWF owner Vince McMahon for some time off to be with his wife Bonnie, who was expecting the birth of their first son, Richard, Jr. This did not sit well with WWF management as he had been groomed to become a long-term champion. The decision was made by WWF management to punish Steamboat by having him initially drop the title to Butch Reed, but Reed did not show up that night, so he dropped to The Honky Tonk Man on the June 13 edition of Superstars; his son was born a month later. Steamboat came back in time for the Survivor Series in November 1987. WWF management was still bitter over his impromptu sabbatical from his first WWF run, however, and he was not pushed or given any meaningful feuds. (Steamboat himself has implied in interviews that he was being punished for one-upping the Hogan-Andre main event at WrestleMania III.) After defeating Ravishing Rick Rude by disqualification at 1988 Royal Rumble, Steamboat was entered into the tournament for the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania IV in March 1988. On WWF television prior to the match, Steamboat appeared in a vignette where he stated that he hoped Randy Savage would win his first round match, thus setting up a rematch of last year’s WrestleMania match and “one more classic confrontation”. However, Steamboat would lose to his first round opponent Greg “The Hammer” Valentine. Although television segments were shot immediately after WrestleMania IV that made it appear that Steamboat would be facing Valentine in a series of matches, Steamboat left the WWF shortly thereafter.</p><h3>Did Randy Savage really injure Ricky Steamboat?</h3><p><b>The calculating Savage attacked Steamboat after their IC title match on WWF Superstars in November 1986</b>.
