The beloved <a href=#>Charlie’s Angels</a> actress always “dreamed” of owning a spectacular estate in the prestigious Los Angeles neighborhood.</p><p>Her dream became a reality in 1999 when Tanya and her late husband, Barry Roberts, went house-hunting in Southern California. While chatting with Closer Weekly in 2015, the late star recalled the time she spotted a “for sale” sign that led them up a treelined road to a “tucked away, really private” property.</p><p>Up on the hilltop, the former Bond girl found a four-bedroom, four-bath house with a “360-degree view of Los Angeles surrounding every room,” she marveled to Closer, noting Barry was convinced there was no way an abode that gorgeous “could be for sale.”</p><p>“I called the realtor, found out that it was in escrow, and the next day, she called to say the would-be owner used a check they wouldn’t accept,” Tanya explained. “So I got it!” The couple, who married in 1974, paid $780k for the 2,678-square-foot home, according to reports.</p><p>Considering Tanya portrayed the role of Queen of the Jungle in 1984’s Sheena, she had a great fondness for the outdoors. This is the reason she fell in love with her sprawling mansion. “Living here is like being in the country, but civilization isn’t far away when I need it,” the A View to a Kill alum gushed. “It’s the house I’d always dreamed of.”</p><p>Built in 1965, the property was nearly perfect. “I didn’t have to do any major renovations,” Tanya remembered. “All I did was add sliding glass doors around the dining area.”</p><p>However, the backyard was a different story. Tanya added spectacular gardens, palm trees and a koi pond with a wooden bridge, mirroring the jungles she roamed in Sheena. “This place is full of wildlife,” said Tanya. “The decor has a very ‘island’ feel to it.”</p><p>Tanya shared the home with Barry, who died in 2006. Later, she lived there with her second husband, Lance O’Brien.</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see photos inside the star’s gorgeous home.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e9OapbKZXae8o7HRrapmn5WpwG6uwJyiZqyfYruiwNSrnGahnmK1pr6Mm5yaraSes7a4jKGmpaSprLywsIyhoKWko2K1sLnEZmxrcWhq</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
