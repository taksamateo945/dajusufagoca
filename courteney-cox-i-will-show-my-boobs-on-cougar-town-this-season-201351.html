I'm getting older, so I've decided at this point I'm taking less focus off the face, and focusing [on my chest].

"You know what? I'm getting older, so I've decided at this point I'm taking less focus off the face, and focusing [on my chest]. By the time I'm much older, I will just be absolutely nude. I think it's gonna work for me, I hope."</p><p>In fact, the actress and her onscreen love interest, <strong>Josh Hopkins</strong>, did strip down for an upcoming episode in which their characters, Jules and Grayson, hold a "naked day" to spice up their marriage.</p><p>"I did know in advance [but] I did not take advantage of the time I had to know," she told <strong><a href=#>Us Weekly</a></strong> after the panel of how she prepared for the nude scenes. "Lighting is everything! I'm not kidding. You could walk into a room and go, 'Wow! I look great today.' And one step further, you're like, 'Oh my God, I look horrible!'"</p><p>Of course, fans won't actually see any nudity on the TBS sitcom. However, they may see some familiar faces — namely, the actress' former&nbsp;Friends co-stars — if the show gets picked up for a fifth season. <strong><a href=#>Lisa Kudrow</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a></strong> have already made guest appearances on past seasons, but Cox hopes to get her other Central Perk pals on board, too.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I'd love to do something with <strong>Matt</strong> [<strong>LeBlanc</strong>]," she told <strong>Us</strong>. Also on her list? <strong><a href=#>Matthew Perry</a></strong>, who played her love interest on Friends, and <strong><a href=#>David Schwimmer</a></strong>, who played her brother.</p><p>"I'd love to see the rest of the cast," she said, adding that she'd happily return the favor by appearing on Perry's new NBC comedy, Go On, or LeBlanc's Showtime series Episodes.</p><p>"I catch reruns of Friends and I don't remember even being there," she told <strong>Us</strong> of her memories of the popular sitcom. "I'm like, 'That is funny!'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOnKauqqSau6bFjJymsWWZYsSquMtmqqGnp2K6unnBqKabq12ku26vzq6emqpdqby4uoytn6KrXaiyor%2FOp2RraGFognI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
