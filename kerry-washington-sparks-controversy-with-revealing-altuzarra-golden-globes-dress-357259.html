One of the most controversial looks of the night was worn by Kerry Washington. She chose an Altzuzarra gown that had no bodice — only a knotted rope fixture that held it at the top. She wore the dress with a blazer. The skirt had a high slit at the side and some people felt that the dress didn’t even look as if it was a finished garment. On the positive side, some people praised Kerry saying she chose to wear something daring and unsafe.&nbsp; Some praised her boldness and said she truly made a statement with the outfit. On the other side, some said the dress looked trashy, was not classy, and appeared as if it had been thrown together at the last minute.</p><p>Kerry carried off the dress proudly and didn’t seem to be aware that there was a controversy brewing with home viewers as she never buttoned up the blazer but left it open.</p><p>You may see several photos of Kerry Washington that Altuzarra shared on their official Instagram account below.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B69lNpVgzHl/</p><p>Kerry’s hair and makeup; however, are winning praise. She wore her hair in a straight, chin-length bob that flattered her features and accentuated her beautiful face. Kerry is known for her beauty and some people felt that the dress was unbecoming to a woman of her beauty and stature.</p><p>Kerry wore a bold, vibrant red lip that was striking with the color of her ensemble. The dress’s bodice showed off plenty of Kerry’s skin and Kerry’s red lip was eye-catching. Her eyebrows were perfectly arched and she wore a light, shimmering eyeshadow on her lids. Her eyes were framed under very long eyelashes and her makeup was beautiful.</p><p>You may see a close up of Kerry Washington’s face and hair in the photos below.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B69tlXBh6Aq/</p><p>Though Kerry’s hair and face were gorgeous, the jury is still out on Kerry’s Altuzarra dress.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What do you think about the revealing dress that she wore? Do you think it was appropriate for the Golden Globes?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebmr%2BzxYywmKygmaO0tbvNZqqpmaKgwG6vzqerq6emmr%2B0xYywoK2gXaeyt7HApaCnn12WubXB2Zqpq5ldnLytsMSnZKCkn5eytHnDq5ysq11ognh%2BlHJm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
