Then, still leading by three in the third quarter, Vols coach Josh Heupel inexplicably went for it on 4th-and-1 from his own 47 and failed to make it.</p><p>Alabama took it down, scored a touchdown, added a scoop-and-score and dominated.</p><p>Maligned Milroe found his stride. McClellan led a rejuvenated running game that had just 16 yards on the ground at the break but followed it up with 68 in the third quarter in a 17-0 frame. The defense smothered Tennessee quarterback Joe Milton after his best half of the year, too.</p><p>Tennessee just collapsed—on both sides of the ball and on the sideline. Heupel coached like the Vols were losing when they were ahead, and Tennessee played like it didn't expect to win in Tuscaloosa.</p><p>Saban is a master in revenge games, and he made sure there wasn't a repeat of last year's Rocky Top revival with a terrific second half in which the Tide did everything right and Tennessee fell apart.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaWl%2Bc4WMnKalpJWcsm6yzqirm5mcoXpzfJFsZLChnqOys7%2BMmqWdZZykwKa%2B0madq6edYsSmscpmbw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
