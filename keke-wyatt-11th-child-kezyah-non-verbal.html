Knowing the risks, Wyatt and her husband, Zackariah David Darring, made the decision to continue the pregnancy.</p><p>“My husband & I made the decision not to accept the Medical Specialist’s suggestion to terminate our baby early despite the positive trisomy 13 test results,” Wyatt said in her 2022 announcement of Ke’Zyah’s birth. “We appreciate and thank God for all of the Dr’s in the medical field. However, I can’t stress enough to all mothers & couples, when the Dr gives you life changing information about your unborn child …. pray about it, use faith & follow your spirit before making ANY final decision.”</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Keke Wyatt (@keke_wyatt)</a></p><p>The chart-topper, most famous for her remake of “My First Love” with Avant,” shared that it “bothers” her that her child may never say anything more than “Mama.”</p><p>She to her Instagram Live and shared with her 1.7 million fans, “I am probably getting ready to face the reality that he may be nonverbal.”</p><p>“He could say ‘Mom,’ but that’s about it,” she revealed before adding, “Not to say he won’t. I have faith in God … that God will do whatever he wants to do, but … as a mother of many, he would have been talking by now if he was going to be verbal.”</p><p>Wyatt confesses that it bothers her that her child will not be able to communicate verbally like her other children. However, she reassured her fans that despite this challenge, her son finds alternative ways to convey his needs, and she has developed an understanding of him through these methods.</p><p>Fans of the singer rallied in <a href=#>support</a> to let her know that her faith in God would carry her through.</p><p>“He will talk and walk at his timing trust in the lord,” one fan said.</p><p>Another person pointed at his nonverbal ways of getting his mother’s attention and expression, saying, “He is grabbing be grateful for that! That is a milestone and shows gods promise that life is precious.”</p><p>“Don’t count him out just yet some kids take a little longer to speak than others,” a comment read.</p><p>Unfortunately, the comment section was not without some negativity. Some social media users called Wyatt and her husband selfish for proceeding with their pregnancy, knowing that their child would have challenges from his disorder.</p><p>“Im sorry, but choosing to have him knowing he would suffer is selfish,” one comment read in part. “He was pre-diagnosed while u were pregnant but u still went through with the pregnancy although u had time to spare him of this.”</p><p>There were also comments on social media that were compassionate about her plight, sympathizing with her sadness without judging her.</p><p>“I feel so bad for Keke Wyatt. Her baby has Patau syndrome. She was advised by her doctors to terminate but she trusted in God to deliver a healthy baby and now she’s struggling to raise a child who has a disability. Heartbreaking,” an X user tweeted.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I feel so bad for Keke Wyatt. Her baby has Patau syndrome.
