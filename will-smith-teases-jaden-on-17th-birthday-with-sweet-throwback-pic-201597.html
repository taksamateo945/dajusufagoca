To mark the teen actor/rapper’s 17th birthday on Wednesday, July 8, the Independence Day star took to <a href=#>Facebook</a> to tease his son on a worldwide platform. “Jaden is 17 years old today,” the proud dad blogged, adding a photo of his smiley son as a toddler sitting in a birdcage. “I’m just glad he stopped eating paste!”</p><p>Jaden’s mom, <a href=#><strong>Jada Pinkett Smith</strong></a>, also Facebooked her birthday greetings Wednesday. Mom’s message, however, followed the traditional sappy mom route. “To my son, Today you are 17. It was on this day a tremendous gift was delivered to me. A baby boy, whose existence reflected back to me all the passion, curiosity, love, and beauty that only a child could collect from the deepest recesses of his mother’s secret heart and breathe it into the world,” the Magic Mike XXL actress, 43, wrote.</p><p>“You have made the beauty I could only feel within myself absolutely tangible. You were not only born from my body, but born from my soul,” she continued. “You are a light of my heart and a light from my deepest wishes. I am so grateful for you.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>There’s no question the Smith family — which also includes <a href=#><strong>Willow</strong></a> and Will’s eldest son Trey — are as tight as can be. In April, Jaden celebrated his famous father by shouting him out in his new single, “Offspring.” In it, Jaden raps: “My dad said to beat the system, understand it first / My dad’s an inspiration, I respect the man and work / And everything you say is something that you can’t reverse / Something that you can’t rehearse.”</p><p>Will and Jada are proud that their kids have followed in their footsteps in the industry, and developed an equally solid work ethic. “[Jaden] has refused to be a slave to money. I so respect that,” Will told Esquire. “They’re really well-adjusted around this business and understanding the nature of having to take a battering. And Jaden understands that that’s a part of this business. If he wants to do it, there’s a certain amount of battery that you have to be willing to live through.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaK6ipJxiwK6106FkrZ2RqLK0ecmam56mXaS7bn2WrZ9mmpmnwamwwLJksKGknXq0w8Seq2asmKe8uK7AnKJmqJmYenN8kG5wcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
