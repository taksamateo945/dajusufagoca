It all started when French was spotted celebrating with the family during Kendall Jenner’s 19th birthday, and then the same week the ex-pair decided to go in halfsies on a gift for mutual friend Sean “Diddy” Combs – which just so happened to be a brand new pearl white Escalade.</p><p>Now it’s French Montana’s turn to celebrate his own birthday – his 30th – and it appears that he’s being shown quite a bit of love by the reality star, and it’s got people wondering exactly what it is that’s going on.</p><p>“Happy birthday baby boy! In only a short amount of time we have created timeless memories. Happy birthday to a man who genuinely lives life to its fullest. ‘What’s understood doesn’t need to be explained,’ @frenchmontana I can’t wait to celebrate life with you tonight! You deserve it!” she captioned on an Instagram photo of the two of them in a very romantic embrace on the beach from over the summer.</p><p>So, what’s the deal with these two? Apparently Kardashian’s Instagram followers wanted to know the same thing and started hating on her photo, so the reality star decided to take the bait and explain herself just a little bit.</p><p>“I guess some people don’t’ have genuine love for people anymore. Blows my mind how critical human beings are these days. Love is love! Some of y’all need a hug!” she posted. Isn’t that the truth?</p><p>As far as Montana, he’s a bit more open about their relationship, in such a coy manner. “Our relationship – you break up, you make up, you break up, you make up. We went through that a couple times. You never know,” he said recently. Maybe we do know.</p><p>Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGidq52emLVuuc6nq5qmkWK4qbjOnmSkmaKZrrS0yJqlZpqRmLhuwM6gnK2glad8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
