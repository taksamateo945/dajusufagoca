They tackle the glorious and not so beautiful angels of his life.</p><h3>Mbuso Mandela age</h3><p class=align-left>He was born to Makgatho Lewanika Mandela as the third of four boys. Mbuso Mandela's date of birth is unclear, although he was born in 1991. Therefore, he has or will be turning thirty-one in 2022.</p><h3>Mbuso Mandela's parents</h3><p class=align-left>Makgatho Lewanika, his father, was the son of Nelson Mandela and his first wife, Evelyn Mase. Makgatho, who was born in 1950, died in 2006 due to AIDS-related complications.</p><p class=align-left>Mbuso Mandela's father was married twice. His first wife, Rose Rayne Perry, bore him his eldest son, Mandla. His second wife was Zondi, and she gave birth to Ndaba.</p><h3>Mbuso Mandela's wife</h3><p class=align-left>In 2012, Mbuso and his elder brother Mandla made headlines after Mandla accused him of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">having a secret affair</a> with his then-wife, Anaias Grimaud. During a news conference that was broadcast live on TV, he stunned <a href=#>Mzansi</a> when he revealed that Mbuso had sired his young son, Zanethemba.</p><p class=align-left>He went ahead to state:</p>Mbuso impregnated my wife,<p class=align-left>Mandla also accused the family of rebuffing his efforts to get the family to address the questions regarding Zanethemba's paternity.</p><p class=align-left>Mbuso, however, denied the allegations, stating:</p>The facts are there.

A video of the former president's grandson admitting to abusing his girlfriend is making rounds on social media platforms. The video has since then sparked mixed reactions from social media users. In the video, which has since then been deleted from Mbuso Mandela's Instagram account, he seems intoxicated as he confesses,</p>My name is Mbuso Mandela [and] I am a woman abuser. I put my girlfriend's head through the window and through the Trellidor. I strangled her; she needs me to admit it, so I am admitting it in front of everybody; to everybody, thank you,<h3>Mbuso Mandela's girlfriend' name</h3><p class=align-left>Grace Machel's daughter, Josina Machel, an activist against gender-based violence, shared the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">video on Instagram</a>. Later, another video of a woman alleged to be Mbuso Mandela's girlfriend was shared on Twitter. The second video is purported to counter the effects of the first video. The woman in question is seen to refute the claims of being abused by the former president's grandson.</p><p class=align-left>She claims,</p>I get why he posted that because in our angry little fight, we had [I] called his bluff and said he would never try and ruin his reputation, and it was wrong. I admit that completely.As you can see, there are no bruises; my face is fine. Not too sure where he has hit my head through a Trellidor because [I'm] pretty sure it will be swollen.You will notice, however, there is a blue mark over there [pointing to her arm], but that happened on Thursday, I bumped into a person and got a blue mark, and I bruise easily. So as you can see, nothing.<p class=align-left>Ndaba, Mbuso's brother, was asked to comment on the matter, but he maintained he was not in a position to have interviews with anyone.</p><h4><strong>Alleged assault</strong></h4><p class=align-left>In 2015, Mbuso was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">accused of assaulting</a> a 41-year-old woman after reportedly having sex with her.
