Kylie Jenner has 177 million followers who scour every photo fo some sort of imperfection or proof that Kylie is faking her pictures â€” and they find plenty. Kylie has made her image into a billion-dollar empire and followers are quick to point out when Kylieâ€™s image isnâ€™t lining up with perceived reality.</p><p>When Kylie was spotted without her wig, dark makeup to look stand, and eating a bag of chips during the Coronavirus lockdown the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pictures immediately</a> went viral.</p><p>Kylie Jenner posted the four photos below to her Instagram account. Once fans saw the photoshop fail and pointed it out, she took the photos down and replaced them.</p><p>See if you can find the photoshop fail below.</p><p>https://twitter.com/wichocantu98/status/1255224084486651906</p><p>Did you see it?
