Aussie band members, Luke Hemmings, Calum Hood, Ashton Irwin, and Michael Clifford are an inspiration to their fans and, whether they’re aware of it or not, they motivate fans to do what they love.
5SOS and the art that they create, fuels fans’ need to create their own art."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Also at the time, I thought Wattpad was only a place for fanfiction so I thought I had to write a fanfic. Now I know I can write whatever genre I want.</p><h3>What do you love about writing on wattpad and writing in general?</h3><p>I have so many ideas in my head all the time and writing allows me to get those ideas out. I can create whoever I want in my stories, and the characters become so real to me and my readers. I like that I can create something that others can connect to so deeply, that’s the main reason I started to write on Wattpad. I wanted my stories to help or inspire others. On Wattpad, I like that I can see how my readers feel about the story. They can comment or message me. It’s like having an instant editor. They tell me what they like or dislike, if there’s a typo, or what they think should happen next. I also just enjoy talking to my readers and hearing everything they have to say.</p><h3>5SOS talked about your book at soundcheck during their summer tour, Sounds Live Feels Live. How does it feel knowing they think your book is cool and possibly read it while on tour?</h3><p>It’s so exciting!!! It also makes me kind of nervous knowing that my book is in their tour bus. It is really cool though that they actually know who I am!</p><h3>In what ways have 5SOS impacted your life?</h3><p>I’ve made a lot of great friends because of 5SOS. At one point, 99% of my friends were people I had met from Twitter because we all liked 5SOS. It’s amazing that one band can bring so many people together. Also, without 5SOS, I wouldn’t have my book or my YouTube Channel. I started making videos after seeing theirs. Since “Remember to Forget” started as a 5SOS fanfic, it may even exist if I wasn’t a fan of 5SOS. I wouldn’t even be me without them.</p><h3>You’re a YouTuber and you sing as well. Do you think 5SOS fueled your want to make music or share your stories in anyway?</h3><p>I started posting covers on my YouTube channel mostly because of 5SOS. I started liking them when they weren’t very well known. Seeing how they made covers, which was something I always wanted to do, and end up opening for One Direction really pushed me to post my first cover. “Heartbreak Girl” was my first cover, and it was the first song I ever learned on the guitar.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fo7GQi2L4w</p><h3>Do you feel like you would be the same person without 5SOS?</h3><p>Definitely not. I have no idea what I would be doing with my life. As mentioned earlier, I wouldn’t have my book, my YouTube, or half my friends. I probably wouldn’t be as happy as I am today without them! My personality has changed a lot (for the better) the past few years because of all the things I’ve done. Without 5SOS, I wouldn’t have done anything to change who I am. My music taste would also be really terrible.</p><h3>What have 5SOS taught you?</h3><p>5SOS has taught me how to run after busses quickly! All joking aside, 5SOS has indirectly taught me how to play guitar, because without them, I don’t think I would have been interested to learn it. They’ve also helped me become more confident and happy.* What’s it like being a writer in the 5SOS fam?<br>It’s amazing! I love having such great people supporting me, and we all have similar interests! There’s so many fantastic people that I’m lucky enough to have as friends or supporters.</p><h3>If you had the chance to thank 5SOS, what would you say?</h3><p>I’d thank 5SOS for everything that has happened in my life because of them. I have so many amazing friends and met fantastic people that I wouldn’t know if it wasn’t for them. I wouldn’t have my YouTube channel or my book. I’d like to thank them for helping get to where I am!</p><p><i>How does 5 Seconds of Summer inspire you?
