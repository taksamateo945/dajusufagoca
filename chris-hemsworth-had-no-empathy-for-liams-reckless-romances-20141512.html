Chris Hemsworth opened up about little brother Liam — and that protective fraternal instinct — in the January 2014 issue of GQ magazine.
“I’ve watched Liam do things I did at his age,” Elsa Pataky‘s husband, 31, told the mag of his 24-year-old sibling. “Like being in relationships he shouldn’t be in, or being reckless just to prove a point. And I had no empathy. My mom had to remind me I was the same way."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I spent years being angsty, constantly telling people I wasn’t just part of a soap opera, that I was a real artist. And I remember Luke sort of snapping, telling me to shut up, that he was sick of hearing it.”</p><p>Chris credited Luke for making him well-rounded and less self-important as an actor. His big brother, and Dancing With the Stars, in fact. The Thor stud competed on the Australian version of DWTS in 2006, where he landed in fifth place. “After that show, I could never pull the serious, self-important card again,” he joked.</p><p>In addition to his brothers, Hemsworth said his family life with his stunning model wife and their three kids — daughter <strong>India</strong>, 2, and twin sons<strong> Tristan</strong> and <strong>Sasha</strong>, 8 months — has grounded him. “The fame, the parties, the women — I did that stuff back home,” Hemsworth recalled of when he starred on Home and Away. “I got away with a lot more over there. Then I came here and sort of started over.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=635 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Chris Hemsworth GQ Cover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>When it comes to being a father, Hemsworth struggled with worries at first. “Just not screwing it up,” he confessed was his biggest concern.</p><p>Thankfully, he’s found a friend and confidant in fellow superstar <strong><a href=#>Matt Damon</a></strong>. “We became friends around the time I started to work, and I’ve really benefited from watching how he handles himself,” Hemsworth told the mag. “Matt’s just a normal guy who has the movie-star thing figured out.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJqhqpmoeqmxzKyuqKqknXqprcNmpahllaK9osDHsmSfp6JiuaqtzKxkq52ToLmmv9JmqailkaOwpr%2BMa2dqbGFqfnM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
