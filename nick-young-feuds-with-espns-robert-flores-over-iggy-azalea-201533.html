Flores held the monthly "What Did We Learn?" segment and looked back on an <a href=#>earlier story</a> in which Young, 29, admitted to reporters after a Los Angeles Lakers game that he was once attacked by dolphins.</p><p>"What did we learn? We learned that, according to the Lakers' Nick Young, a dolphin recently tried to kill him," <a href=#>Flores quipped</a>. "So, Nick, while dolphins are trying to kill you, your girlfriend is trying to kill hip-hop. Let's call it even, okay?"</p><p>Though his tweets have since been deleted, the basketball player <a href=#>reportedly shot back at Flores on Twitter</a>. "I'm pretty sure we going to run into each other soon," he tweeted at the anchor, according to saved screenshots of his words. "You job is to talk about sports not what me and my chick got going on. So off the fact you [thought] that was cool to say, don't sit right with me so we got a problem."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Later, Flores addressed the feud on an ESPN Radio show, and took further hits at Young by bringing in his shooting stats. "If you look at his numbers, there is a 70 percent chance that, if he takes a shot at me, he’s going to miss," <a href=#>Flores jibed</a>. "I'm just looking at the numbers, so I'm good."</p><p>After deleting his tweets, <a href=#>Young added</a>, "Since these Sports Channels want to like they BET we shall see… Its cool to talk about me all day any day I find with that, &nbsp;I can take a joke .. That what I do joke, but I didn't see the point of that… Got a lotta people tryna drain me of my energy."&nbsp;</p><p>Azalea, 24, has not commented on the feud, which isn't surprising: She recently decided to hand her social media accounts over to her team. After facing negative comments about her body and regularly getting pulled into feuds, <a href=#>she wrote</a>, "I am taking some time away from social media. I need to be happy and it is too negative and draining."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKWim5tixrDBzaBkn52lmcBuw8itn2ado6W7tHnRqJmeqqRis6270Z6qZqemmr9utcagsGaZqpa5pq2Ma2dqbWNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
