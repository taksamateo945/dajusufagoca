Tia broke the news in a February interview on “The Tamron Hall Show.” When Tamron asked Tia if “Sister, Sister” would return: she responded, “So many people are asking this question. We tried to do it, but some rights and stuff kind of got in the way and that makes me sad.” She added: “And then also we tried to reboot “The Game” and that’s now not happening. I just guess reboots are not in my DNA.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9xe49xZmtvX5myp7XNoquepKlirm6vy5qqrKGTYsGqrYymprCqqWK1or7Dq6CcrF2ptaK6yqxkn5meqHqistOeqWasmJp6qK3MnmSrnZGYtaa%2FjK2mqWVhZXqwuoynnK2enJ7FcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
