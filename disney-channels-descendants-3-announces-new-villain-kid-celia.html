So, it wasn’t an exact surprise that back in February, it was <a href=#>announced that a third movie</a> in the Disney Descendants franchise was coming. However, what was a surprise was <a href=#>the teaser video that accompanied the announcement</a> – you so need to check it out if you haven’t seen it yet. Then, yesterday, they revealed a brand new villain kid, Celia.</p><p>Celia will be played by Jadah Marie, who is best known for playing Natasha ‘Tasha’ Mann in the TV show&nbsp;Mann And Wife. The new villain kid is the daughter of Dr. Facilier who is from&nbsp;The Princess And The Frog. But, that wasn’t the only cast announcement. Descendants 3 has also cast the role of Dr. Facilier, Celia’s father. He will be played by Jamal Sims, who is best known for his choreography career and has also been a special guest on&nbsp;RuPaul’s Drag Race. He’s done choreography for the likes of the&nbsp;Step Up&nbsp;franchise,&nbsp;Vanilla Sky,&nbsp;17 Again,&nbsp;Hannah Montana: The Movie,&nbsp;Footloose (2009), and the upcoming Disney live-action film&nbsp;Aladdin. He will also be acting as choreographer for&nbsp;Descendants 3.</p><p>These announcements were all made on a video that was released on the Descendants YouTube Channel, which has over one million subscribers.</p><h3>Check Out The Descendants 3 Announcement Video Here:</h3><p></p><p>This has certainly got people guessing as to whether Dr. Facilier is Mal’s father, which would make Celia, Mal’s half-sister. However, it seems that the Descendant fans aren’t into this idea, and they’re all hoping that Mal’s dad is someone else.</p><p>Not only that, but if Dr. Facilier is making an appearance in Descendants 3, does that mean that the parents of the other villain kids will make an appearance too? We sure hope so, as we missed the likes of Maleficent (played by Kristin Chenoweth), the Evil Queen (played by Kathy Najimy), Jafar (played by Maz Jobrani), and Cruella de Vil (played by Wendy Raquel Robinson), in the second Descendants&nbsp;movie. If this is the case, they’ll have to cast Uma’s mother, Ursula, who never actually appeared in Descendants 2, we just heard her off-screen. Not only that, but we would love to see Captain Hook and Gaston make an appearance too, as their sons, Harry and Gil respectively, were prominent characters in Descendants 2.</p><p>The brand new film in the franchise has already started filming. It is expected to be released in 2019 and we really cannot wait.</p><h4>What do you make of the two new cast characters for&nbsp;Descendants 3?
