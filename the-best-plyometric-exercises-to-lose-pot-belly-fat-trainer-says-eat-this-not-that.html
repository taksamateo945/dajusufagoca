Plyometrics is one of the best exercises you can incorporate into your fitness program. It can help you develop speed and power, wake up your nervous system before your workout, and help you recruit more motor units and muscle fibers. This allows you to build more muscle and burn more calories to lose pot belly fat. The one caveat? Although plyometric exercises provide tremendous benefits, they’re often programmed improperly in HIIT classes and other circuit training studios.</p><p>Many fitness establishments have their trainees perform multiple reps and sets, often as fast as possible within a certain time interval. When it comes to performing plyometrics, however, they should be done in a controlled environment, focusing on exploding and getting as much power out of the movement while practicing safe landing mechanics. Performing them this way will keep your joints healthy, pain-free, and injury-free.</p><p>If you’re not used to doing plyometrics and want to start putting them into your workouts, here are four movements that are a great starting point. Check them out below, and get ready to lose pot belly fat fast.

Keeping your chest tall and core tight, throw your hips and your arms back while dipping into a quarter squat, then reverse the motion and jump up as high as you can with your arms all the way up. Land softly into a mini squat, and reset before performing another rep. Perform 8 to 10 reps.</p><p>Related: The #1 Workout To Lose Your Beer Gut for Good, Trainer Says</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/07/box-jump.jpg><p>If you haven’t done a Box Jump before, make sure you master the squat form first and start with a low box. Begin by facing a box or bench just one arm’s length away. Keeping your core tight, swing your arms back, and dip into a squat, then immediately spring up and jump onto the box, landing softly. Stick the landing with your knees tracking straight and then step back down before performing another rep. Complete 5 to 8 reps.</p><p>Related: Get a Flatter Stomach With These Quick Daily Exercises, Trainer Says</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/07/medicine-ball-slam.jpg><p>For this next exercise, grab a giant medicine ball, and position your feet outside shoulder width.
