That has ended all because he opened his mouth in a bizarre rant riddled with controversy.</p><p>On Monday morning, country singer and voice of the Monday Night Football anthem Hank Williams took to Fox News' Fox & Friends.</p><p>He was asked to voice his opinions on the state of the GOP and their candidates for president. This avenue took him down a dark road as he compared President Barack Obama to Adolf Hitler, and stated that he and Vice President Joe Biden were "the enemy."</p><p>His appearance has sparked far more controversy than ESPN would like to deal with. They have since eliminated Williams and the anthem from the Monday Night Football intro.</p><p>In the video, Williams took exception to a golf exhibition that took place between Speaker of the House John Boehner and the President.</p><p>He states in the video, "It would be like Hitler playing golf with (Israeli leader) Benjamin Netanyahu." When asked to clarify his statement, Williams continues, "I'm glad you don't brother, because a lot of people do. They're the enemy... Obama! And Biden! Are you kidding? The Three Stooges."</p><p>The network has since released a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> that reads:</p><p>While Hank Williams, Jr. is not an ESPN employee, we recognize that he is closely linked to our company through the open to Monday Night Football.&nbsp; We are extremely disappointed with his comments, and as a result we have decided to pull the open from tonight’s telecast.</p><p>Williams will no doubt continue with his political aspirations as he has said he's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interested</a> in running as a Republican in 2012 for a U.S. Senate seat in Tennessee.</p><p><strong>UPDATE: Monday, October 3rd, 9:00 p.m. ET</strong></p><p>Hank Williams Jr. Has since released a statement elaborating on what was meant by his analogy. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Tennessean</a> posted the following from Williams:</p><p>“Some of us have strong opinions and are often misunderstood. My analogy was extreme – but it was to make a point. I was simply trying to explain how stupid it seemed to me - how ludicrous that pairing was. They’re polar opposites and it made no sense. They don’t see eye-to-eye and never will. I have always respected the office of the President.”</p><p>“Every time the media brings up the tea party it’s painted as racist and extremists – but there’s never a backlash – no outrage to those comparisons… Working class people are hurting – and it doesn’t seem like anybody cares. When both sides are high-fiving it on the ninth hole when everybody else is without a job – it makes a whole lot of us angry. Something has to change. The policies have to change.”</p><p>– Hank Williams, Jr.</p><p>Williams may have done well to elaborate with a much more nuanced response to the questions he was asked.</p><p>We all have our opinions, but should be ready to receive the brunt of the alternate view, especially when they are delivered with such nonchalance and controversy.</p><p><strong>UPDATE: Monday, October 3rd, 9:30 p.m. ET</strong></p><p>The start of Monday Night's game highlighted the national anthem in lieu of Williams' song. <strong></strong></p><p>There is no way of knowing where the network goes from here. It is safe to say it will never be the same though. <strong><br></strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/follow_me-c.png alt="Follow gabezal on Twitter" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJob3BvY2h%2FbrTAp6Jmr5mhuaqtzKxko6pdmsCxuoybmKerXaK8r7DAsmSnoZedwW6yzqirm5mcoXqiutOhnKZlkZvBpr6Mm6CzmaKnsm6%2BwKer</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
