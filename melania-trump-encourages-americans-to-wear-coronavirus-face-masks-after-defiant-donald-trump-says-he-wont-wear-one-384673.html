There has been great debate over the use of face masks as the CDC initially recommended that only health care workers, sick people, and those caring for the sick wear them. As there is a current shortage of N95 masks and surgical masks for health care workers, the CDC wanted to ensure that people don’t hoard them. Now that more has been learned about the deadly Coronavirus, it has become apparent that airborne transmissions do happen. It is now recommended that face masks are worn in public to try and reduce the number of new Coronavirus cases. Since health care workers need N95 and surgical masks, it is recommended that people wear cloth masks or any type of face-covering made of cloth.</p><p>Many people weren’t surprised that Donald Trump chose not to wear a face mask.
