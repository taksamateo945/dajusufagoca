Her performance as Bridget Sanchez in Blue Water High sparked a lot of discussions. She also nailed the part of Phyllis in The Pacific. Her performance in the television film A Model Daughter: The Killing of Caroline Byrne was also noteworthy.</p><h2>New Girlfriend On The Block?</h2><p>There’s another twist to the plot as well. They don’t seem to be dating since Cariba is dating her boyfriend and partner, Jamie Timony.
