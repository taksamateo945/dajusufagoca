In 2014, he produced and released his debut single, Trap Queen. While the track was recorded and uploaded in February, it didn’t gain traction until the end of the year.</p><p>In August of 2014, Fetty recorded a music video for the track, uploading it to YouTube. By 2020, this video had received almost 700 million views. You can watch this video at the link below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>&nbsp;As the song was discovered by more and more people on Soundcloud, Fetty’s posture grew. He secured a recording contract with a record label based in New York. This was close to Fetty’s home state of New Jersey.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, Fetty would ride on the back of Trap Queen for well over a year. He didn’t release his second single until June of 2015. This was essentially the barn door opening, as mixtapes and singles began to flow shortly after.&nbsp;</p><p>Fetty began securing accolades as fast as he could. In mid-2015, he became the first male rapper in three years to occupy top twenty spots with three songs on the Billboard Hot 100. Since then, Fetty Wap has secured numerous awards and nominations.</p><p>He continued to favor singles as time went on, as by 2020 he had released just one studio album. In this year, a second studio album was teased after five years of sporadic single releases.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Not Without Struggle</h2><p>Fetty Wap – real name Willie Junior Maxwell II – came into music quite late in his life. Although he was born in 1991, it wasn’t until 2013 that he began taking an interest in music. Fetty grew up in Paterson, New Jersey, an arguably rough location.&nbsp;</p><p>He certainly had his run-ins with crime as he transitioned into adulthood. From 2016 onwards, he became enveloped in several lawsuits. These included copyright infringement and contract violations, primarily.</p><p>In 2017, he was arrested for DUI, after being caught speeding through Brooklyn at one hundred miles per hour. This string of mishaps continued, and in 2019 he was arrested in Las Vegas. On this occasion, it was alleged that Fetty had assaulted employees of a hotel.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, in 2020, Fetty was sued for allegedly assaulting a woman in his home the year prior. The <a href=# rel=noopener>struggles continued in Fetty’s personal life</a>, as he went through a divorce and fathered seven children (at least).&nbsp;</p><p>This reckless trend may stem from his upbringing, however. <a href=# rel=noopener>In an interview in 2016</a>, Fetty confirmed that he would get into fights and be bullied as a child. The bullies targeted Fetty owing to him only having one eye, as a result of congenital glaucoma.&nbsp;</p><p>He also went on to explain that as a teenager, he was near homeless, and dealt drugs. He would sleep on the floors of his friends’ homes, trying to earn money however he could. While music has straightened out some rappers who found trouble in their earlier lives, that doesn’t seem to be the case for Fetty.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2020, Fetty Wap<a href=# rel=noopener> published a short clip on his Instagram</a>, showing him messing around in the street with friends. He was atop an ATV, which he tried pulling tricks on, but ultimately wound up crashing into a nearby SUV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfmqxdrK60ecWeq62xXayusb%2BMn6Crq6RiwLC6xmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
