Kroll.</p><p><a href=#>She’s played the role of Sharon Newman for 30 years.</a> The actress found it hard to believe that she received a nomination for her performance on the CBS daytime soap. Sharon is ecstatic to be part of the club for the first time ever.</p><p>“I hadn’t had any nominations for a long time, so that makes it all the more special,” Sharon explained. “I’m just thrilled that I get to go to the Emmys in this category with all of my colleagues who are also nominated. It’s going to be a fun night.”</p><p>She jokingly compared the Leading Ladies Lunch to the Fight Club, in which you hear about it but don’t speak about it. Sharon even recalled never seeing pictures of it before. The soap star even wondered if it existed or if it was made up. She can’t wait to join the following Leading Ladies at lunch.</p><p><img alt="Sharon Case" width=800 height=567 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2023/06/sharon-case-breaks-silence-on-first-ever-lead-actress-nomination/ data-jpibfi-post-title="Sharon Case Breaks Silence On First-Ever Lead Actress Nomination" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sharon-Case-2.jpg></p><h3>Shares Praise For Y&R Fanbase</h3><p><a href=#>During the interview,</a> Sharon Case also shared her praise for her fans, who supported her throughout the years.
