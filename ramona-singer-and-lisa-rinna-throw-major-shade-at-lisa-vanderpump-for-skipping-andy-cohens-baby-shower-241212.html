Lisa didn’t show up. She should show up. It’s about Andy,” Singer shared. “It’s about Andy. She should have shown up! Are you kidding me?”</p><p>Although Vanderpump was not at the party, she did give Cohen a gift in celebration of his baby. According to All About The Real Housewives, Vanderpump also Face-Timed the Bravo host on the night of the bash and congratulated him.</p><p>Ramona Singer, meanwhile, is not the only one who is shading Vanderpump. Lisa Rinna also got in on the fun by posting a new cast photo for the upcoming season of RHOBH. The only problem with the image is that Rinna photoshopped Vanderpump out of the pic.</p><p>The dig was clearly making fun of how Vanderpump refused to film portions of the upcoming season with her co-stars. Vanderpump has not responded to Lisa Rinna’s post, but it probably didn’t help mend their relationship.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BtM09hfAVt1/</p><p>While her co-stars were partying it up with Cohen, Vanderpump was in Las Vegas attending to business matters. The Vanderpump Rules star was in Sin City organizing the opening of her latest restaurant venture, which is why should could not make Cohen’s event.</p><p>Last month, Cohen revealed that he is expecting his first baby via surrogacy. The Watch What Happens Live host also revealed that the child will be a boy, and we could not be more excited for him.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Fans can follow Lisa Vanderpump when the new season of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills premieres Feb. 12 on Bravo.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeilrqwusBmqqKml5q%2Fbq3NnWSloaOWerO1zaeYZqyYp7y4ecyaoaiqXai1orDEZpitZZyewKJ51ZqlnZ2ipcKuvIyfpqtlo6C2sbzIp55mmZ6Zxm6vzqGcp6tdl66jxYysn6ivlad6c4CQa2hrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
