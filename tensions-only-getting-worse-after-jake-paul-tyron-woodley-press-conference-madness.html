 A verbal and physical altercation following Thursday’s news conference between Jake Paul and Tyron Woodley got so bad that Showtime Sports may add more security to keep the two sides apart going forward.
The latest incident occurred when Woodley heard someone from Paul’s team make a disparaging comment about Woodley’s mother, Deborah, who was in attendance. That sparked Woodley’s sister to verbally clap back, while Woodley tried fighting his way through the crowd to the alleged trash-talker."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That sparked Woodley’s sister to verbally clap back, while Woodley tried fighting his way through the crowd to the alleged trash-talker. He was held back.</p><p>Both sides got into a shoving match while vulgar language continued to fly between the camps. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Woodley later told ESPN</a> after the incident, “One thing I don’t do is disrespect. And when disrespect comes to my mother, it’s a whole issue. F–k this money, f–k this bag, f–k the pay-per-view, f–k the fight. When it comes to that, it will not be tolerated.</p><p>“He don’t know no better,” Woodley continued. “He don’t know this lifestyle. I’ll shake this whole f–king room in a way you ain’t never seen. F–k the UFC s–t, f–k the knockout s–t. I will f–king start hurting people. You’ll start seeing orange [Paul’s team’s colors] start dropping and hitting the floor.”</p><p><strong>Warning: Graphic Language</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><p>Despite Woodley demanding an apology from Paul’s camp, Paul refused to concede.</p><p>“I don’t think it’s needed,” Paul said. “There’s only a couple more days left of me dealing with him or seeing him. I’m sure everyone is gonna go home, eat their dinners and get over it. We’re all men and women at the end of the day. We’re not going to be resentful.”</p><p>Woodley’s mother, Deborah, is a fixture at her son’s fights and beloved by the UFC community. She is known for being particularly supportive towards her son’s opponents. Deborah even had a heartwarming moment with Paul’s own mother when they met in June, photographed hugging ahead of their sons’ face-off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/08/jake-paul-tyron-woodley.jpg><p>Deborah told “The Mac Life” after Thursday’s altercation that she didn’t know the reason for the comments that came from J’Leon Love, the member of Paul’s camp in question.</p><p>“I don’t know [why J’Leon Love was talking to me],” she said. “He said that he was doing his job. Maybe that’s what he gets paid to do.”</p><p>Woodley will have the chance for revenge against Paul and his camp on Sunday. The former UFC welterweight champion will likely give the mega-YouTube star-turned-pro boxer the toughest challenge of his career when they face off in Cleveland.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpJq7tLXOp6pmp56hxm6zxK2roqaXYsSwvtKeZJqepJq%2FbrbApJxmqJGquW7A2Kump2WnpLyluMSyZKmqlajAbq%2FOp52eqpWjsKZ5zJqbp52jqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
