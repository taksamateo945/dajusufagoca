"I think I've taken to intermittent fasting like a fish to water," she says. "I find that the benefits of it are just immense. For one, intermittent fasting helps do a system cleanse as it removes the toxins from the body. It clears my gut and rejuvenates all my energy systems."</span></p><p><span>Chopra revealed her favorite form of exercise to Times of India. "Suryanamaskar is my go-to exercise. It relieves me of all the stress, especially the in the back.
