The league issued a video statement on the ruling:
Domi attempted to get Ekblad to drop the gloves by grabbing the defender's sweater and delivering a couple of left-handed blows. When Ekblad refrained from fighting, though, Domi didn't move on—he instead dropped his right glove and delivered a punch to the blueliner's face."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"You don't do that. You respect your opponents, and if your opponent doesn't want to engage in a fight, there's no reason to drop your glove and punch him square in the face. Bit of a gutless play. You don't do those types of things."&nbsp;</p><p>Luongo was not alone in his anger, either.</p><p>"It was a punk move by him," Panthers defenseman Keith Yandle&nbsp;said, per<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Basu</a>. "I know Max, he plays the game hard, but that's just something. ... He said he asked him to go and Ek in the video had no interest in fighting. It's a preseason game, it's our first game trying to get familiar with each other. Even in the regular season, a play like that's not good for anyone."</p><p>Meanwhile, at least one Montreal player defended Domi.</p><p>"The two were arguing with one another," Canadiens forward Jonathan Drouin said, per the AP (via ESPN.com). "I saw a pretty big slash from Ekblad on Max, and Max just took matters into his own hands. It's also Ekblad's fault for not protecting himself."</p><p>The league agreed with the Panthers, issuing a&nbsp;ban for the rest of the preseason. The suspension does not carry over into the regular season.</p><p><span>Montreal acquired Domi from the <a href=#>Arizona Coyotes</a> in June for&nbsp;</span><span>Alex Galchenyuk, later signing him to a<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two-year deal</a><span>. Domi, 23, tallied nine goals and 36 assists for 45 points in Arizona last season, racking up a career-high 73 penalty minutes.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaXBxZm1%2Fd3nMmq9mnJ%2Bitm6%2F1KynnqaUmrFuss6rZKmqlaiyor%2FOp2SanqSav26%2F1JyinqpdpcKvr8dmpp9lkZa%2FsLqMnqKbpJGZ</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
