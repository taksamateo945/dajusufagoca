But she stole her mom’s credit card instead and used it to fly out Schaefer in a $12,000 business class seat, her trial was told.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In text messages presented in court Schaefer urged his teen lover to suffocate Sheila so they could claim her estate, which he believed was worth up to $11 million.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He ended up doing the job himself in gruesome fashion – battering the political strategist with a metal bowl until she suffocated from a broken nose.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Schaefer testified that Sheila had racially abused him and tried to strangle him during an argument about the pregnancy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In reality, the besotted lovers had plotted to kill her months and had already tried but failed to kill her by overdose.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They also enlisted advice from his US-based cousin Robert Bibbs, who was later jailed for nine years in the US for his part in the scheming – offering an avenue Feds could explore to bring a fresh prosecution.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Behind bars, Mack was said to have left her life of crime behind, however, going to church, organizing fashion shows and teaching other inmates to dance.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In her a 2019 interview with DailyMail.com Mack said she also felt ‘more Indonesian than American’, and could speak both the Indonesian language and the local Bahasa Balinese dialect</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘My daughter is more Indonesian than American.

I know that it will happen to me but I will do my best to protect Stella from that trauma.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mack’s sentence was shortened by President Joko Widodo by a total of 34 months due to reductions often granted to prisoners on major holidays because of good conduct.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After being released, Mack stayed at an immigration detention center for four days while waiting for her flight tickets and travel documents to be ready.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She was closely escorted by immigration officers to Bali´s airport for a flight to Jakarta on Tuesday afternoon.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Jamaruli Manihuruk, chief of the Bali regional office of the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, said she would fly from Jakarta to Chicago on Delta Airlines. He said his office has asked the central government to ban Mack from Indonesia for life.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mack previously said that she does not plan to stay in Chicago, where she will be living with a friend, for long.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I might get deported (back to America) on release but if that happens I hope it will only be for a maximum of six months.
