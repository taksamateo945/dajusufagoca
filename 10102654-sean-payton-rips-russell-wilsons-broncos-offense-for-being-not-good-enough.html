"That has to get cleaned up. That's communication. That might be having to reduce — is there too much in? Right now, we're average to below average in a lot of things offensively, and it's not good enough."</p><p>The dynamic between Payton and Russell Wilson has been carefully monitored all season, but it's under a microscope right now. He was seen <a href=# rel=noopener>yelling</a> at his quarterback on the sideline in the third quarter of the Broncos' 42-17 loss to the Denver Broncos in Week 15.</p><p>Payton downplayed that moment after the game, telling reporters he was upset about an offsides call and wasn't yelling at Wilson.</p>Andrew Mason <span class=acct>@MaseDenver</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sean Payton said when he was yelling on the sideline on the direction of Russell Wilson, he was "upset about the call," referring to the offsides penalty, and not yelling at Wilson. &lt;br>&lt;br>He added later, "What I talk with Russell about is none of your business." &lt;a href="https://t.co/AxVgk9Qmiq">pic.twitter.com/AxVgk9Qmiq&lt;/a></p><p>Wilson continues to be <a href=# rel=noopener>asked</a> about his future with the Broncos, though he isn't answering those questions.</p><p>The Broncos looked like they turned a corner after starting the season 1-5. They won five straight games to get over .500 and were firmly in the wild-card mix in the AFC.</p><p>Since Week 13, though, things have fallen off for Denver. The team has lost three of its last four games, including Sunday's 26-23 loss to the New England Patriots.</p><p>The offense has been held under 300 yards in each of those losses and committed a total of eight turnovers over the past five weeks.</p><p>Wilson is playing better this season than he did in 2022. He has thrown for 3,020 yards, 26 touchdowns and is completing 66.4 percent of his attempts, but there's been a lack of consistency that has contributed to the offensive struggles.</p><p>The Broncos enter Week 17 with a <a href=# rel=noopener>six percent chance</a> to make the playoffs. They are currently in 12th place in the AFC with a 7-8 record, tied with the Las Vegas Raiders and behind four teams with 8-7 records.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGeDdoCMrJyapl2lrrrAzqdkq6GgqHqzwdKsnKWkXay2rb%2FOp6pmmqKku6S70mamn56Vo8CmecWoqWaalZ67qHnNqKtmn5%2BksW6xzaisoKA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
