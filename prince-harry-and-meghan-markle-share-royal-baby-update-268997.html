The Duke and Duchess look forward to sharing the exciting news with everyone once they have had an opportunity to celebrate privately as a new family,‚Äù began the message.</p><p>Yes, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have a much less publicized birth, as well as royal baby reveal. There will be an official announcement from the palace when Markle goes into labor. Once their first child is born, they will likely reveal all the birth details, including name, sex, etc. on their <a href=#>personal Instagram account</a>.</p><p>When the little one is born, royal watchers will not be given an immediate glimpse of the baby. They are going to ditch the public viewing of their little one on the hospital steps, like Prince William and Kate Middleton did with all three of their kids.</p><p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have opted to do a family photo shoot on the grounds of Windsor Castle. It will take place within the first few days of the new royal baby‚Äôs birth, and the parents will then release those pictures to the public.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry won‚Äôt immediately announce the birth of their baby to the public <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/lMwQAwjBiu</a></p><p>‚Äî The Sun (@TheSun) <a href=# rel=nofollow>April 11, 2019</a></p><p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have given the public a royal baby update. Their plan is entirely different from The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. It is their purgative to spend some quality time with their little one before sharing him or her with the world, as well as not wanting the media frenzy that surrounded William and Kate.</p><p>‚ÄúThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very grateful for the goodwill they have received from people throughout the United Kingdom and around the world as they prepare to welcome their baby,‚Äù the Palace stated as it ended Prince Harry and Meghan Markle‚Äôs official statement.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Royal baby watch has begun, but it is going to be a whole different ballgame. Baby Sussex arrival will not be the media circus that was the birth of Prince George, Princesses Charlotte, and Prince Louis.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGegp7avr8Rmn5qqoq56orrDZqSen5iWu265wKuipZ1dqLWivsRmqaixkaF6o63BsmSuqJSWwaZ5kW9vcnFnZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
